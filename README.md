# Multi-patch Hierarchical Network with Non-local Information for Real World Image Denoising

## Highlights

- **Lightweight:** The proposed system is very lightweight, as the total size of the model is around 22.5 MB.
- **Fast:** It can process an HD image in 0.018 seconds on average and can denoise images from a video sequence in real-time.

## Running the Training

For model training, run the following commands
```
1. Upload the Train dataset SIDD_Small_sRGB_Only.zip and validation files ValidationNoisyBlocksSrgb.mat and ValidationGtBlocksSrgb.mat on Google Drive.
2. Run the notebook Image_Denoising_Using_Multipatch_Hierarchical_Network.ipynb

```
